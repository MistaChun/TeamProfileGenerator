This small application is based on Object-Oriented Programming that will take in information about employees and generate an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

In the Develop folder, there is a package.json, so make sure to npm install.
The dependencies are, jest for running the provided tests, and inquirer for collecting input from the user.
There are also unit tests to help you build the classes necessary.
It is recommended that you follow this workflow:

Remember, you can run the tests at any time with npm run test
